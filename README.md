### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<--
**howtodie123/howtodie123** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on no company
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning no subject
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on no body
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about your stupid
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: no way
- âš¡ Fun fact: this file doesn't exist
